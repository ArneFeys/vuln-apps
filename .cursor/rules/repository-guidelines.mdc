# Repository Purpose

This repository contains purpose-built vulnerable applications designed to test AI pentesting tools and security automation systems.

# Code Guidelines

## Simplicity and Clarity

- Keep code simple and concise
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or complexity
- Each vulnerability should be easy to identify and understand
- Use straightforward, readable code without clever tricks

## Documentation

- Keep READMEs concise and to the point
- Focus on: setup instructions, vulnerability descriptions, and exploitation examples
- No emojis in documentation
- Document what vulnerabilities exist and where they are located
- Include clear examples of how to exploit each vulnerability

## Application Structure

- Each app should be self-contained with its own Docker setup
- Maintain separate `vulnerable/` and `fixed/` versions where applicable
- Keep dependencies minimal - only include what's necessary
- Use standard, well-known frameworks and libraries

## Vulnerability Design

- Vulnerabilities should be intentional and clearly documented
- Each vulnerability should represent a real-world security issue
- Avoid obscure or contrived vulnerabilities
- Make vulnerabilities realistic but obvious enough for testing AI tools

## Technical Standards

- Use Docker for consistent deployment
- Keep Docker configurations simple
- Minimize external dependencies
- Use standard ports and configurations where possible
- Ensure applications can run in isolated environments

## Testing Considerations

- Applications should be easily scannable by automated tools
- Include multiple vulnerability types per application when appropriate
- Ensure vulnerabilities are reproducible
- Provide working exploit examples in documentation

# When Making Changes

- Maintain consistency across applications
- Test that vulnerabilities are exploitable as documented
- Keep fixed versions truly fixed (no residual vulnerabilities)
- Update documentation if behavior changes
